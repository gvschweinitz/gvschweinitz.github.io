Since the financial crisis, the volume of credit has been the linchpin of policymaking geared toward financial stability and macroprudential policy. For example, the credit-to-GDP gap is key in the Basel III regulation and the setting of countercyclical capital buffers, and private credit stocks and flows are among the scoreboard indicators employed for the European macroeconomic imbalances procedure. These two regulatory initiatives monitor the developments of credit volumes, but focus on different sides of the market. Countercyclical capital buffers are aimed at regulating credit supply, while the scoreboard has an eye on firm and household (over-)indebtedness and hence credit demand. Thus, understanding to what extent fluctuations are due to demand or supply is crucial for formulating policy and for assessing the macroeconomic implications. Using a novel approach to identification that combines multiple sources of information, this project aims at disentangling credit supply and credit demand shocks to examine their dynamic effects on the real economy and their contributions to historical fluctuations in credit volumes.","tags":null,"title":"How do credit supply and demand influence business cycle dynamics?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ruben Staffa and Gregor von Schweinitz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598400000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598400000,"objectID":"61bb50e56f4ed2766abee9e42e436f05","permalink":"https://gvschweinitz.org/publication/fiscalnewsfinancialmarkets/","publishdate":"2020-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fiscalnewsfinancialmarkets/","section":"publication","summary":"In this project, we aim to provide three contributions.

This result is robust to the choice of performance metric, crisis definition, preference parameter, and sample length, as well as to using different sets of variables and data transformations. Thus, our paper suggests that further enhancements to machine learning early warning models are needed before they are able to offer a substantial value-added for predicting systemic banking crises. Conventional logit models appear to use the available information already fairly efficiently, and would for instance have been able to predict the 2007/2008 financial crisis out-of-sample for many countries.

These models rely on ex-post optimization of signaling thresholds on crisis probabilities accounting for preferences between forecast errors, but come with the crucial drawback of unstable thresholds in recursive estimations. We propose two alternatives for threshold setting with similar or better out-of-sample performance; (i) including preferences in the estimation itself and (ii) setting thresholds ex-ante according to preferences only. Given probabilistic model output, it is intuitive that a decision rule is independent of the data or model specification, as thresholds on probabilities represent a willingness to issue a false alarm vis-à-vis missing a crisis. We provide real-world and simulation evidence that this simplification results in stable thresholds, while keeping or improving on out-of-sample performance. Our solution is not restricted to binary-choice models, but directly transferable to the signaling approach and all probabilistic early-warning models.","tags":null,"title":"Optimizing Policymakers' Loss Function in Crisis Prediction: Before, Within or After?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Makram El-Shagi and Gregor von Schweinitz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543622400,"objectID":"911ec8805e67318b7633a9d26206f023","permalink":"https://gvschweinitz.org/publication/jointdynamics_jbf/","publishdate":"2018-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jointdynamics_jbf/","section":"publication","summary":"Can a negative shock to sovereign ratings invoke a vicious cycle of increasing government bond yields and further downgrades, ultimately pushing a country toward default? The narratives of public and political discussions, as well as of some widely cited papers, suggest this possibility. In this paper, we will investigate the possible existence of such a vicious cycle. We find no evidence of a bad long-run equilibrium and cannot confirm a feedback loop leading into default as a transitory state for all but the very worst ratings. We use a bivariate semiparametric dynamic panel model to reproduce the joint dynamics of sovereign ratings and government bond yields. The individual equations resemble Pesaran-type cointegration models, which allow for valid interference regardless of whether the employed variables display unit-root behavior. To incorporate most of the empirical features previously documented (separately) in the literature, we allow for different long-run relationships in both equations, nonlinearities in the level effects of ratings, and asymmetric effects in changes of ratings and yields. Our finding of a single good equilibrium implies the slow convergence of ratings and yields toward this equilibrium. However, the persistence of ratings is sufficiently high that a rating shock can have substantial costs if it occurs at a highly speculative rating or lower. Rating shocks that drive the rating below this threshold can increase the interest rate sharply, and for a long time. Yet, simulation studies based on our estimations show that it is highly improbable that rating agencies can be made responsible for the most dramatic spikes in interest rates.","tags":null,"title":"The Joint Dynamics of Sovereign Ratings and Government Bond Yields","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Makram El-Shagi and Gregor von Schweinitz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1464739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464739200,"objectID":"7f5afc42d11c622d60c3b8c0de981e7d","permalink":"https://gvschweinitz.org/publication/qualvar_japplecon/","publishdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qualvar_japplecon/","section":"publication","summary":"Due to the recent financial crisis, the interest in econometric models that allow to incorporate binary variables (such as the occurrence of a crisis) experienced a huge surge.

Solving economic problems through regular updates (patches) became as important to those games as traditional gameplay issues. In this paper we provide an agent framework inspired by the economic features of Diablo~3 and analyze the effect of monetary policy in the game. Our model reproduces a number of features known from the Diablo~3 economy such as a heterogeneous price development, driven almost exclusively by goods of high quality, a highly unequal wealth distribution and strongly decreasing economic mobility. The basic framework presented in this paper is meant as a stepping stone to further research, where our evidence is used to deepen our understanding of the real-world counterparts of such problems. The advantage of our model is that it combines simplicity that is inherent to model economies with a similarly simple observable counterpart (namely the game environment where real agents interact). By matching the dynamics of the game economy we can thus easily verify that our behavioral assumptions are good approximations to reality.","tags":null,"title":"The Diablo 3 Economy: An Agent Based Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Makram El-Shagi and Gregor von Schweinitz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1423872000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1423872000,"objectID":"bea9ba6437e83d2b591345cf85de4f6b","permalink":"https://gvschweinitz.org/publication/riskandreturn_el/","publishdate":"2015-02-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/riskandreturn_el/","section":"publication","summary":"After every major financial crisis, the question about the responsibility of the rating agencies resurfaces.
