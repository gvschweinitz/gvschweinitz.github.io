Nonetheless, the empirical macroeconomic literature is so far silent on the effect of credit demand shocks on aggregate fluctuations. This paper fills this gap. I  identify a structural credit demand equation together with credit supply, aggregate supply, demand and monetary policy in a Bayesian structural VAR. The model combines informative priors on structural coefficients and multiple external instruments to achieve identification. As an additional novelty, I construct a new granular instrument for credit demand shocks from regional mortgage origination. I find that credit demand is quite elastic with respect to contemporaneous macroeconomic conditions, while credit supply is relatively inelastic. I identify an extremely large expansionary credit demand shock in 2020Q1, which pushed the US economy towards a sustained recovery, helping to avoid a stagflationary scenario in 2022. Furthermore, I document that credit demand shocks mostly drove the boom prior to financial crisis, while credit supply shocks were responsible during the crisis itself. Thus, both shocks matter for aggregate fluctuations, albeit at different times.","tags":["jmp"],"title":"The importance of credit demand for business cycle dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ruben Staffa and Gregor von Schweinitz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1696896000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696896000,"objectID":"4e4acb1902965a798e4138a7a8abbb01","permalink":"https://gvschweinitz.org/publication/rsa-gsz_fiscalnewsfinancialmarkets/","publishdate":"2023-10-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rsa-gsz_fiscalnewsfinancialmarkets/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper studies the interaction between fiscal policy and bondholders against the backdrop of high sovereign debt levels. For our analysis, we investigate the case of Italy, a country that has dealt with high public debt levels for a long time, using a Bayesian structural VAR model. We extend a canonical three variable macro model to include a bond market, consisting of a fiscal rule and a bond demand schedule for long-term government bonds. To identify the model in the presence of political uncertainty and forward-looking investors, we derive an external instrument for bond demand shocks from a novel news ticker data set. Our main results are threefold. First, the interaction between fiscal policy and bondholders' expectations is critical for the evolution of prices. Fiscal policy reinforces contractionary monetary policy through sustained increases in primary surpluses and investors provide incentives for passive fiscal policy. Second, investors' expectations matter for inflation, and we document a Fisherian response of inflation across all maturities in response to a bond demand shock. Third, domestic politics is critical in the determination of bondholders' expectations and an increase in the perceived riskiness of sovereign debt increases inflation and thus complicates the task of controlling price growth.","tags":["ongoing"],"title":"Fiscal Policy under the Eyes of Wary Bondholders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Annika Camehl and Gregor von Schweinitz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1691539200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691539200,"objectID":"15dfa77fccc0d70d457233c156f56763","permalink":"https://gvschweinitz.org/publication/ac-gsz_mpshocks-internationaltransmission/","publishdate":"2023-08-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ac-gsz_mpshocks-internationaltransmission/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that global supply and demand shocks are important drivers of interest rate co-movement across seven advanced economies.

This result is robust to the choice of performance metric, crisis definition, preference parameter, and sample length, as well as to using different sets of variables and data transformations. Thus, our paper suggests that further enhancements to machine learning early warning models are needed before they are able to offer a substantial value-added for predicting systemic banking crises. Conventional logit models appear to use the available information already fairly efficiently, and would for instance have been able to predict the 2007/2008 financial crisis out-of-sample for many countries.

The narratives of public and political discussions, as well as of some widely cited papers, suggest this possibility. In this paper, we will investigate the possible existence of such a vicious cycle. We find no evidence of a bad long-run equilibrium and cannot confirm a feedback loop leading into default as a transitory state for all but the very worst ratings. We use a bivariate semiparametric dynamic panel model to reproduce the joint dynamics of sovereign ratings and government bond yields. The individual equations resemble Pesaran-type cointegration models, which allow for valid interference regardless of whether the employed variables display unit-root behavior. To incorporate most of the empirical features previously documented (separately) in the literature, we allow for different long-run relationships in both equations, nonlinearities in the level effects of ratings, and asymmetric effects in changes of ratings and yields. Our finding of a single good equilibrium implies the slow convergence of ratings and yields toward this equilibrium. However, the persistence of ratings is sufficiently high that a rating shock can have substantial costs if it occurs at a highly speculative rating or lower. Rating shocks that drive the rating below this threshold can increase the interest rate sharply, and for a long time. Yet, simulation studies based on our estimations show that it is highly improbable that rating agencies can be made responsible for the most dramatic spikes in interest rates.","tags":null,"title":"The Joint Dynamics of Sovereign Ratings and Government Bond Yields","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Makram El-Shagi and Gregor von Schweinitz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1464739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464739200,"objectID":"6201e3744e26a67340c7f949667c2df0","permalink":"https://gvschweinitz.org/publication/mei-gsz_qualvar_japplecon/","publishdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mei-gsz_qualvar_japplecon/","section":"publication","summary":"Due to the recent financial crisis, the interest in econometric models that allow to incorporate binary variables (such as the occurrence of a crisis) experienced a huge surge.

Solving economic problems through regular updates (patches) became as important to those games as traditional gameplay issues.

Our model reproduces a number of features known from the Diablo~3 economy such as a heterogeneous price development, driven almost exclusively by goods of high quality, a highly unequal wealth distribution and strongly decreasing economic mobility. The basic framework presented in this paper is meant as a stepping stone to further research, where our evidence is used to deepen our understanding of the real-world counterparts of such problems. The advantage of our model is that it combines simplicity that is inherent to model economies with a similarly simple observable counterpart (namely the game environment where real agents interact). By matching the dynamics of the game economy we can thus easily verify that our behavioral assumptions are good approximations to reality.","tags":null,"title":"The Diablo 3 Economy: An Agent Based Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Makram El-Shagi and Gregor von Schweinitz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1423872000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1423872000,"objectID":"ff828143da23a549428cb926a6382515","permalink":"https://gvschweinitz.org/publication/mei-gsz_riskandreturn_el/","publishdate":"2015-02-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mei-gsz_riskandreturn_el/","section":"publication","summary":"After every major financial crisis, the question about the responsibility of the rating agencies resurfaces.
